# mintsetup
A BASH script to help users set up and maintain a new Linux Mint / Ubuntu installation

**Build Environment:** Linux Mint 17.2 KDE amd64, Sublime Text 3

**Notes:**
- This is an update of an old command-line project, and it is a work in progress.

**To do:**
- Add in an 'offline' menu and remove the Main Menu text regarding internect connection.
- Add better desktop detection to determing whether computer reboots after the BleachBit operation has been completed.
- Optimise all root commands to call sudo *only* when required to increase security.

**Change Log:**
- **16/08/2015**: Updated the script to detect KDE, MATE and Ubuntu desktops and have removed some useless functionality. Some functions have also been abbreviated and optimised.
